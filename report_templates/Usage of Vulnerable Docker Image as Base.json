    "Test case title": "Usage of Vulnerable Docker Image as Base",
    "Background Information": "Using a vulnerable Docker image as a base for building applications can introduce security risks into the entire container ecosystem. These vulnerabilities can include outdated software components, known security flaws, or misconfigured settings. When such images are used as a foundation, the vulnerabilities are propagated to all containers built on top of them, potentially compromising the security of the entire application stack.",
    "Impact": {
        "Overall": "Using vulnerable base images can introduce a wide range of security issues, from minor vulnerabilities to critical flaws that could lead to system compromise.",
        "Confidentiality": "Vulnerabilities in the base image could potentially be exploited to access sensitive data within containers or the host system.",
        "Integrity": "Compromised containers could be used to modify application data or behavior.",
        "Availability": "Some vulnerabilities in base images could be exploited to crash containers or the host system.",
        "Sample": "A container built on a base image with an outdated OpenSSL library could be vulnerable to well-known SSL/TLS attacks."
    },
    "Remediation": [
    "We recommend regularly updating and patching base Docker images, and using minimal, security-focused base images like Alpine or distroless images where possible. Implement a process for vetting and approving base images before use, and keep an inventory of all base images used and their versions.",
    "We suggest using container scanning tools to detect vulnerabilities in images and implementing a continuous monitoring system for container security. Additionally, implement policies to automatically rebuild containers when base images are updated.",
    "We also recommend using multi-stage builds to minimize the final image size and attack surface, and educating developers about the importance of using secure and up-to-date base images."
