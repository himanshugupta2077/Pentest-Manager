    "Test case title": "Lack of Input Validation in Source Code",
    "Background Information": "Input validation is a crucial security practice that involves verifying and sanitizing all input data before processing it. A lack of proper input validation can lead to various security vulnerabilities, including injection attacks, cross-site scripting (XSS), and other forms of data manipulation. When applications fail to validate input properly, they risk processing malicious data that can compromise the system's security and integrity.",
    "Impact": {
        "Overall": "Lack of input validation can lead to a wide range of security vulnerabilities, potentially resulting in unauthorized access, data breaches, or system compromise.",
        "Confidentiality": "Malicious input could be used to extract sensitive information from the application or database.",
        "Integrity": "Improper validation can allow attackers to insert, modify, or delete data unexpectedly.",
        "Availability": "Some forms of malicious input could crash the application or cause denial of service.",
        "Sample": "An attacker could inject SQL commands into an unvalidated input field, potentially gaining unauthorized access to the database."
    },
    "Remediation": [
        "Implement strict input validation for all user-supplied data.",
        "Use a 'whitelist' approach, allowing only known good input rather than trying to block bad input.",
        "Validate input for type, length, format, and range.",
        "Implement server-side validation in addition to any client-side validation.",
        "Use parameterized queries or prepared statements for database operations to prevent SQL injection.",
        "Encode output to prevent XSS attacks.",
        "Use input validation libraries or frameworks when available.",
        "Implement content security policies (CSP) to mitigate the impact of any successful XSS attacks.",
        "Regularly review and test input validation mechanisms.",
        "Educate developers about the importance of input validation and secure coding practices."
