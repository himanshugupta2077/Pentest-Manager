{
    "Test case title": "CSV Injection",
    "Background Information": "CSV Injection, also known as Formula Injection, is a vulnerability that occurs when user-supplied input is directly included in CSV (Comma Separated Values) files without proper sanitization. This can allow attackers to inject malicious formulas or commands that get executed when the CSV file is opened in spreadsheet software like Microsoft Excel.",
    "Impact": {
        "Overall": "CSV Injection can lead to data theft, malware execution, and potential system compromise on the machines of users who open the infected CSV files.",
        "Confidentiality": "Malicious formulas could exfiltrate sensitive data from the user's system.",
        "Integrity": "Injected content could modify other data in the spreadsheet or on the user's system.",
        "Availability": "Malicious formulas could crash the spreadsheet software or affect system stability.",
        "Sample": "An attacker could inject a formula that, when the CSV is opened in Excel, executes arbitrary commands on the user's system."
    },
    "Remediation": [
        "We recommend implementing strict input validation and sanitization for all user-supplied data that may end up in CSV files. Specifically, we suggest prefixing cells starting with '=', '+', '-', or '@' with a single quote (') to prevent formula execution.",
        "We also recommend using a CSV parsing library that offers protection against CSV injection, rather than manually constructing CSV strings. Additionally, we suggest implementing output encoding to ensure that special characters are properly escaped.",
        "Lastly, we recommend educating users about the risks of opening untrusted CSV files and encouraging them to disable automatic formula execution in their spreadsheet software. We also suggest considering alternative data formats like JSON for data exchange if formula execution is not required."
