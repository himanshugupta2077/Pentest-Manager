    "Test case title": "Lack of Protection against Tapjacking Attacks",
    "Background Information": "Tapjacking, also known as UI redressing, is an attack where a malicious app overlays its UI on top of a legitimate app, tricking users into interacting with the malicious app while believing they're interacting with the legitimate one. This can lead to unauthorized actions or data theft.",
    "Impact": {
        "Overall": "Tapjacking can lead to unauthorized actions being performed on behalf of the user, potentially resulting in data theft or financial loss.",
        "Confidentiality": "Sensitive information could be captured by the malicious overlay.",
        "Integrity": "Unauthorized actions could be performed, compromising the integrity of user data or transactions.",
        "Availability": "No direct impact on availability, but user trust in the app could be severely diminished.",
        "Sample": "An attacker could overlay a fake login screen over a banking app, capturing the user's credentials."
    },
    "Remediation": [
        "We recommend implementing the FLAG_SECURE window flag to prevent screen capturing and protect against overlay attacks. Additionally, we suggest using the setFilterTouchesWhenObscured() method to reject touch events from windows that may be obscured by other windows.",
        "We also recommend implementing visual or haptic feedback for important actions to help users identify if they're interacting with the intended app. Furthermore, we suggest using the getWindow().getDecorView().getWindowVisibility() method to detect if your app's window is visible to the user.",
        "Lastly, we recommend educating users about the risks of tapjacking and encouraging them to be cautious when granting overlay permissions to apps. We also suggest regularly updating the app to incorporate the latest Android security features and best practices for preventing UI redressing attacks."
