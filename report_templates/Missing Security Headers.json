{
    "Test case title": "Missing Security Headers",
    "Background Information": "Security headers are a set of HTTP response headers that, when properly configured, can enhance the security of web applications. These headers instruct web browsers to behave in specific ways that mitigate certain types of attacks. Missing or improperly configured security headers can leave web applications vulnerable to various attacks such as cross-site scripting (XSS), clickjacking, and man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks.",
    "Impact": {
        "Overall": "The absence of proper security headers can expose web applications to a range of attacks, potentially compromising user data and application integrity.",
        "Confidentiality": "Lack of certain headers can make it easier for attackers to steal sensitive information through attacks like XSS.",
        "Integrity": "Missing headers can allow attackers to inject malicious content or manipulate the application's behavior.",
        "Availability": "Some headers protect against denial-of-service attacks, and their absence could leave the application more vulnerable.",
        "Sample": "Without the X-Frame-Options header, an attacker could embed the application in an iframe on a malicious site, facilitating clickjacking attacks."
    },
    "Remediation": [
        "Implement and properly configure the following key security headers:",
        "- Content-Security-Policy (CSP): Mitigates XSS and other injection attacks",
        "- X-Frame-Options: Prevents clickjacking attacks",
        "- X-Content-Type-Options: Prevents MIME type sniffing",
        "- Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS): Enforces HTTPS connections",
        "- X-XSS-Protection: Provides additional XSS protection for older browsers",
        "- Referrer-Policy: Controls the Referer header",
        "- Permissions-Policy: Controls which browser features the application can use",
        "Regularly test and verify the correct implementation of security headers.",
        "Use security header scanning tools to identify missing or misconfigured headers."
