    "Test case title": "Use of Outdated and Vulnerable Components",
    "Background Information": "The use of outdated or vulnerable components in web applications poses significant security risks. These components, which can include libraries, frameworks, or other software dependencies, may contain known vulnerabilities that attackers can exploit. As new vulnerabilities are discovered and patched in newer versions, using outdated components leaves applications exposed to potential attacks. This issue is particularly prevalent in complex applications with numerous dependencies.",
    "Impact": {
        "Overall": "The impact of using vulnerable components can range from minor information disclosure to complete system compromise, depending on the nature of the vulnerability and how the component is used within the application.",
        "Confidentiality": "Exploiting vulnerabilities in outdated components can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data or systems.",
        "Integrity": "Attackers may be able to modify data or inject malicious code through vulnerabilities in outdated components.",
        "Availability": "Some vulnerabilities in outdated components can be exploited to cause system crashes or denial of service conditions.",
        "Sample": "An outdated version of a popular web framework with a known SQL injection vulnerability could allow an attacker to extract sensitive data from the database."
    },
    "Remediation": [
        "Maintain an up-to-date inventory of all components and their versions used in the application.",
        "Regularly check for updates and security advisories related to your components.",
        "Implement a patch management process to promptly update vulnerable components.",
        "Use automated tools to scan for vulnerable dependencies in your project.",
        "Consider using a software composition analysis (SCA) tool in your development pipeline.",
        "Implement a policy to regularly review and update all third-party components.",
        "Remove unused dependencies to reduce the attack surface."
