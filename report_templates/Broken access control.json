    "Test case title": "Broken access control",
    "Background Information": "Broken access control is a security vulnerability that arises when restrictions on what authenticated users are allowed to do are not properly enforced. This flaw can enable attackers to gain unauthorized access to restricted resources or functions, often by manipulating URLs, accessing APIs with improper permissions, or exploiting misconfigured security settings. It can result in unauthorized actions like viewing sensitive data, modifying records, or escalating privileges, ultimately compromising the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of an application. Robust access control mechanisms, thorough testing, and proper configuration management are essential to mitigate this risk.",
    "Impact": {
        "Overall":"Broken access control can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive information and critical functionality, potentially resulting in data breaches, unauthorized modifications, and service disruptions. The severity of the impact depends on the extent of the access gained and the criticality of the affected resources.",
        "Confidentiality":"Attackers can access confidential data, such as personal information, financial records, and proprietary business information, leading to privacy violations and significant data breaches.",
        "Integrity":"Unauthorized users can modify, delete, or corrupt data, undermining the accuracy and reliability of the system. This can result in fraudulent transactions, data loss, and damaged reputation.",
        "Availability":"Exploiting broken access control can disrupt service availability by allowing attackers to perform actions such as deleting critical data, disabling security controls, or executing denial-of-service attacks, thereby rendering the application or system unusable for legitimate users.",
        "Sample":"Exploiting this vulnerability does not directly impact the availability of the application."
    },
    "Remediation": [
        "We recommend implementing and consistently enforcing access controls across your entire application. This includes your APIs, URLs, and administrative functions.",
        "We also recommend using role-based access control (RBAC) to assign permissions based on user roles. We strongly advise adopting the principle of least privilege in your system.",
        "We suggest employing strong authentication methods in your application. Specifically, we recommend implementing multi-factor authentication (MFA) to add an additional layer of security.",
        "We highly recommend regularly auditing and testing your access controls. This ensures they are functioning as intended and helps maintain the security of your system.",
        "Finally, we advise implementing proper session management in your application. This will help prevent unauthorized access through session-related vulnerabilities."
