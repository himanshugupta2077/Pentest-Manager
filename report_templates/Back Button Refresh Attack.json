    "Test case title": "Back Button Refresh Attack",
    "Background Information": "A back button refresh attack, also known as a back button cache attack, occurs when sensitive information from a previous session is cached by the browser and can be accessed by using the back button after logout. This vulnerability arises from improper session management and caching controls. It can allow unauthorized users to view sensitive data or perform actions as the previous user, especially on shared or public computers.",
    "Impact": {
        "Overall": "This vulnerability can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive information and potential session hijacking, particularly in shared computing environments.",
        "Confidentiality": "Sensitive data from previous sessions may be exposed to unauthorized users who have physical access to the device.",
        "Integrity": "While primarily a confidentiality issue, in some cases, an attacker might be able to submit or modify data as the previous user.",
        "Availability": "This vulnerability doesn't typically impact availability directly.",
        "Sample": "After a user logs out of their online banking session on a public computer, the next user could press the back button to view the previous user's account details."
    },
    "Remediation": [
        "We recommend implementing proper cache control headers to prevent browsers from caching sensitive pages. Specifically, we suggest using 'Cache-Control: no-store, no-cache, must-revalidate', setting 'Pragma: no-cache', and setting 'Expires: 0' or a past date.",
        "We also recommend ensuring proper session management, ensuring that sessions are fully terminated on logout. Additionally, we suggest using POST requests instead of GET for sensitive operations to prevent caching.",
        "We recommend implementing re-authentication for sensitive actions, even within an active session, to enhance security. Additionally, consider using JavaScript to clear the browser's history when the user logs out.",
        "Lastly, we recommend educating users about the risks of using sensitive applications on shared computers to promote security awareness."
