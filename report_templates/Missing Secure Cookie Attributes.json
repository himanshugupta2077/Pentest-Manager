{
    "Test case title": "Missing Secure Cookie Attributes",
    "Background Information": "Secure cookie attributes such as 'Secure', 'HttpOnly', and 'SameSite' are crucial for protecting cookies from various attacks. The 'Secure' flag ensures cookies are only sent over HTTPS, 'HttpOnly' prevents JavaScript access to cookies, and 'SameSite' helps prevent cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks.",
    "Impact": {
        "Overall": "Missing secure cookie attributes can expose cookies to interception, theft, or unauthorized manipulation, potentially leading to session hijacking or CSRF attacks.",
        "Confidentiality": "Cookies transmitted over unencrypted connections could be intercepted, exposing sensitive data.",
        "Integrity": "Cookies accessible by JavaScript could be manipulated by cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.",
        "Availability": "While primarily a confidentiality and integrity issue, compromised sessions could affect service availability for legitimate users.",
        "Sample": "Without the 'Secure' flag, session cookies could be transmitted over HTTP, allowing an attacker to intercept and hijack the user's session."
    },
    "Remediation": [
        "We recommend setting the 'Secure' flag on all cookies to ensure they are only transmitted over HTTPS connections. Additionally, we suggest applying the 'HttpOnly' flag to cookies that don't need to be accessed by client-side scripts, particularly for session cookies.",
        "We also recommend implementing the 'SameSite' attribute on cookies, using 'Strict' for cookies that should never be sent cross-site, or 'Lax' as a safer default. Furthermore, we suggest using the '__Host-' prefix for cookies set from secure origins to provide additional protection.",
        "Lastly, we recommend regularly auditing cookie usage and attributes across your application to ensure consistent and appropriate security measures. We also suggest educating your development team about the importance of secure cookie attributes and incorporating these practices into your coding standards and review processes."
