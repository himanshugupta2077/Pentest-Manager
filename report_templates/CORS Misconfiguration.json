    "Test case title": "CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) Misconfiguration",
    "Background Information": "CORS is a security mechanism that allows web applications running on one domain to access resources from a different domain. CORS misconfiguration occurs when these policies are improperly implemented, often being too permissive. This can potentially allow malicious websites to make unauthorized requests to your application on behalf of a user, leading to various security vulnerabilities including data theft and unauthorized actions.",
    "Impact": {
        "Overall": "CORS misconfigurations can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data and functionality, potentially resulting in data breaches and compromised user accounts.",
        "Confidentiality": "Overly permissive CORS policies can allow malicious sites to read sensitive data from your application, violating user privacy.",
        "Integrity": "In some cases, CORS misconfigurations can enable unauthorized modification of data through cross-origin requests.",
        "Availability": "While primarily a confidentiality issue, extreme cases could impact availability if exploited at scale.",
        "Sample": "A malicious website could make authenticated requests to a banking application with a misconfigured CORS policy, potentially accessing or transferring a user's funds."
    },
    "Remediation": [
    "We recommend implementing a strict CORS policy that only allows necessary origins, methods, and headers, and avoiding the use of wildcard (*) in the Access-Control-Allow-Origin header unless absolutely necessary and safe to do so. For variable origins, validate the origin header server-side before reflecting it in Access-Control-Allow-Origin.",
    "We also suggest using the Access-Control-Allow-Credentials header cautiously, as it allows sending cookies in cross-origin requests. Implement proper Access-Control-Allow-Methods and Access-Control-Allow-Headers restrictions, and set appropriate Access-Control-Max-Age to cache preflight requests efficiently.",
    "Lastly, we recommend regularly auditing and testing CORS configurations to ensure they align with the principle of least privilege, and consider using a content security policy (CSP) in addition to CORS for defense in depth."
