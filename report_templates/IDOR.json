    "Test case title": "Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR)",
    "Background Information": "Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR) is a type of access control vulnerability that occurs when an application uses user-supplied input to access objects directly. This happens when the application fails to verify that the user is authorized to access the requested object. IDOR vulnerabilities can allow attackers to bypass authorization and access resources they shouldn't have permission to, such as private files, other users' data, or restricted functionality.",
    "Impact": {
        "Overall": "IDOR vulnerabilities can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data, manipulation of other users' information, and potential breach of data privacy regulations. The severity depends on the nature of the exposed objects and the extent of the access control bypass.",
        "Confidentiality": "Attackers can access sensitive information belonging to other users or the system, potentially leading to privacy breaches and data theft.",
        "Integrity": "Malicious actors can modify or delete data they shouldn't have access to, compromising the integrity of the application and its data.",
        "Availability": "While IDOR primarily affects confidentiality and integrity, it can indirectly impact availability if critical data is deleted or modified.",
        "Sample": "An attacker could modify the user ID in a request to access or modify another user's account information or private data."
    },
    "Remediation": [
        "We recommend implementing proper authorization checks for every object access, ensuring users can only access objects they are permitted to.",
        "We also recommend using indirect reference maps or other methods to avoid exposing internal object references to users.",
        "We suggest employing strong, server-side session management to validate user permissions for each request.",
        "We recommend implementing the principle of least privilege, ensuring users only have access to the minimum resources necessary.",
        "We also suggest using randomized, unpredictable identifiers for object references instead of sequential or predictable ones."
