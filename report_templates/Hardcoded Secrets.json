{
    "Test case title": "Hardcoded Secrets",
    "Background Information": "Hardcoded secrets in source code refer to sensitive information such as API keys, passwords, or encryption keys that are directly embedded in the application's code. This practice poses a significant security risk as it can lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, and system compromises. Hardcoded secrets are particularly dangerous because they can be easily discovered if the source code is exposed, and they're often difficult to change without modifying and redeploying the code.",
    "Impact": {
        "Overall": "Hardcoded secrets can lead to unauthorized access to systems, services, and data, potentially resulting in severe security breaches.",
        "Confidentiality": "Exposure of hardcoded secrets can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data and systems.",
        "Integrity": "Compromised secrets may allow attackers to modify data or systems without authorization.",
        "Availability": "In extreme cases, exposed secrets could be used to disrupt services or delete critical data.",
        "Sample": "A hardcoded database password in an application's source code could allow an attacker to directly access and manipulate the database."
    },
    "Remediation": [
        "Remove all hardcoded secrets from the source code.",
        "Use environment variables or secure secret management systems to store and access sensitive information.",
        "Implement proper access controls and the principle of least privilege for all secrets.",
        "Use configuration management tools to securely manage and deploy secrets.",
        "Regularly rotate all secrets and credentials.",
        "Implement secret scanning in your CI/CD pipeline to prevent accidental commits of sensitive information.",
        "Educate developers about secure coding practices and the risks of hardcoding secrets.",
        "Conduct regular code reviews and use automated tools to detect hardcoded secrets."
