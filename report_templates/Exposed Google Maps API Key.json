    "Test case title": "Exposed Google Maps API Key",
    "Background Information": "Google Maps API keys are used to authenticate requests associated with your project for usage and billing purposes. When these keys are exposed, they can be misused by unauthorized parties, potentially leading to quota theft, financial losses, and unauthorized access to services.",
    "Impact": {
        "Overall": "An exposed API key can lead to unauthorized usage of Google Maps services, potentially resulting in financial losses and service disruptions.",
        "Confidentiality": "While the key itself doesn't directly expose confidential data, it could be used to access project-related information.",
        "Integrity": "Unauthorized use could affect usage statistics and potentially the integrity of map data if write access is enabled.",
        "Availability": "Excessive unauthorized use could exhaust quotas, leading to service unavailability for legitimate users.",
        "Sample": "An attacker could use the exposed API key to make large numbers of API requests, quickly exhausting your quota and incurring significant charges."
    },
    "Remediation": [
        "We recommend immediately revoking the exposed API key and generating a new one. Additionally, we suggest implementing API key restrictions in the Google Cloud Console, limiting the key's usage to specific IP addresses, referrer URLs, or mobile apps.",
        "We also recommend storing API keys securely, such as using environment variables or secure key management systems, rather than hardcoding them in source code or client-side scripts. Furthermore, we suggest implementing proper access controls to limit who can view or modify API keys.",
        "Lastly, we recommend regularly auditing and rotating API keys as part of your security practices. We also suggest monitoring API usage for any suspicious activity and setting up alerts for unusual usage patterns."
