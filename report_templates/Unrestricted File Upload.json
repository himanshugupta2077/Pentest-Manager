{
    "Test case title": "Unrestricted File Upload",
    "Background Information": "Unrestricted file upload vulnerabilities occur when web applications allow users to upload files without proper validation of the file type, size, or content. This can lead to various security risks, including the execution of malicious scripts, overwriting of critical files, or potential system compromise. Attackers can exploit this vulnerability to upload and execute malicious code, potentially gaining unauthorized access to the server or launching further attacks on the application and its users.",
    "Impact": {
        "Overall": "Unrestricted file uploads can lead to remote code execution, defacement of websites, or full system compromise, posing a severe risk to the application and its infrastructure.",
        "Confidentiality": "Malicious files could be used to access sensitive data on the server or within the application.",
        "Integrity": "Uploaded files could overwrite existing files or introduce malicious content, compromising the integrity of the system.",
        "Availability": "Large or malicious files could consume server resources or crash applications, affecting system availability.",
        "Sample": "An attacker could upload a PHP shell disguised as an image file, allowing them to execute arbitrary commands on the server."
    },
    "Remediation": [
        "We recommend implementing strict file type validation using file extension checks and MIME type verification. Additionally, we suggest using a whitelist of allowed file types rather than a blacklist of prohibited types to enhance security.",
        "We also recommend implementing file size restrictions to prevent denial of service attacks and resource exhaustion. Furthermore, we suggest storing uploaded files in a directory that's outside the web root, with restricted permissions, to prevent direct access and execution.",
        "We recommend implementing virus/malware scanning for all uploaded files before storing them on the server. Additionally, we suggest using a Content Delivery Network (CDN) or separate domain for serving user-uploaded content to mitigate potential cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.",
        "Lastly, we recommend renaming uploaded files to random, unpredictable names to prevent overwriting of existing files and to obfuscate the file storage structure. We also suggest implementing proper access controls to ensure that users can only access their own uploaded files."
