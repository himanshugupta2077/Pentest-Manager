{
    "Test case title": "Missing DNS CAA Record",
    "Background Information": "DNS Certification Authority Authorization (CAA) is a DNS resource record that allows domain owners to specify which Certificate Authorities (CAs) are authorized to issue SSL/TLS certificates for their domains. The absence of a CAA record means any CA can issue certificates for the domain, potentially increasing the risk of unauthorized certificate issuance.",
    "Impact": {
        "Overall": "Without CAA records, there's an increased risk of unauthorized SSL/TLS certificates being issued for your domain, potentially facilitating phishing attacks or man-in-the-middle attacks.",
        "Confidentiality": "Unauthorized certificates could be used to intercept encrypted traffic, compromising data confidentiality.",
        "Integrity": "Malicious certificates could be used to serve modified content to users, compromising data integrity.",
        "Availability": "While primarily a confidentiality and integrity issue, widespread mistrust due to unauthorized certificates could impact service availability.",
        "Sample": "An attacker could potentially obtain an unauthorized SSL certificate for your domain and use it to create a convincing phishing site."
    },
    "Remediation": [
        "We recommend implementing CAA records for your domain to specify which Certificate Authorities are allowed to issue certificates for your domain. Additionally, we suggest including a CAA record that provides an email address or URL for reporting unauthorized certificate issuance attempts.",
        "We also recommend regularly auditing your DNS records to ensure CAA records are present and correctly configured. Furthermore, we suggest implementing a monitoring system to alert you of any changes to your DNS CAA records.",
        "Lastly, we recommend keeping informed about the CAA policies of your chosen Certificate Authorities and adjusting your CAA records as necessary. We also suggest considering the use of additional technologies like Certificate Transparency logs to further protect against unauthorized certificate issuance."
