{
    "Test case title": "Information Leakage - API Keys and Secrets in Web Page Content",
    "Background Information": "Information leakage occurs when sensitive data is unintentionally exposed in web page content, source code, or client-side scripts. This vulnerability is particularly critical when it involves API keys, tokens, or other secrets. Such exposure can happen due to developer oversight, improper configuration, or inadequate security practices. Attackers can exploit this information to gain unauthorized access to systems, services, or data, potentially leading to severe security breaches.",
    "Impact": {
        "Overall": "Exposure of API keys and secrets can lead to unauthorized access to services, data breaches, and potential system compromise. The severity depends on the nature of the exposed credentials and the scope of access they provide.",
        "Confidentiality": "Attackers can use exposed credentials to access sensitive data or services, potentially leading to large-scale data breaches.",
        "Integrity": "With unauthorized access, malicious actors might be able to modify or manipulate data in connected systems or services.",
        "Availability": "Compromised API keys could be used to exhaust resource quotas or perform denial-of-service attacks on connected services.",
        "Sample": "An attacker finding an exposed AWS access key in JavaScript source code could potentially access and manipulate cloud resources."
    },
    "Remediation": [
        "Implement a secrets management system to securely store and retrieve sensitive information.",
        "Use environment variables or secure configuration management tools to handle secrets, rather than hardcoding them in source code.",
        "Regularly audit code and configurations for exposed secrets, using automated tools where possible.",
        "Implement proper access controls and the principle of least privilege for all API keys and secrets.",
        "Use secret scanning tools in your CI/CD pipeline to prevent accidental commits of sensitive information.",
        "Rotate API keys and secrets regularly, and immediately upon any suspected compromise."
