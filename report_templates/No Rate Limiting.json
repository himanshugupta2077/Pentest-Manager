    "Test case title": "No Rate Limiting",
    "Background Information": "Rate limiting is a technique used to control the amount of incoming and outgoing traffic to or from a network, application, or API. Without rate limiting, systems are vulnerable to various forms of abuse, including brute-force attacks, denial of service (DoS) attacks, and excessive resource consumption.",
    "Impact": {
        "Overall": "Lack of rate limiting can lead to service disruptions, increased vulnerability to attacks, and potential system overload or crashes.",
        "Confidentiality": "Unlimited login attempts could facilitate brute-force attacks, compromising user accounts.",
        "Integrity": "Excessive requests could overwhelm input validation mechanisms, potentially leading to data integrity issues.",
        "Availability": "Unrestricted request rates could lead to resource exhaustion and service unavailability.",
        "Sample": "An attacker could perform a brute-force attack on user accounts, making thousands of login attempts per second without any restrictions."
    },
    "Remediation": [
        "We recommend implementing rate limiting across all critical endpoints, particularly for authentication-related functions, sensitive operations, and resource-intensive requests. Additionally, we suggest using a combination of IP-based and user-based rate limiting to provide comprehensive protection.",
        "We also recommend setting appropriate rate limits based on the nature of each endpoint and your application's capacity. Furthermore, we suggest implementing progressive rate limiting, where limits become stricter as usage increases, to balance usability and security.",
        "Lastly, we recommend monitoring and logging rate limit violations to detect potential attacks or abusive behavior. We also suggest implementing clear error responses when rate limits are exceeded, providing users with information about when they can retry their request."
