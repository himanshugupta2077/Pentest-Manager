    "Test case title": "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
    "Background Information": "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) is a web security vulnerability that allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users. This occurs when an application includes untrusted data in a web page without proper validation or escaping. XSS attacks can be categorized into three types: Reflected XSS, Stored XSS, and DOM-based XSS. These attacks can lead to theft of sensitive information, session hijacking, defacement of websites, and distribution of malware.",
    "Impact": {
        "Overall": "XSS vulnerabilities can have severe consequences, ranging from data theft to complete account takeover. The impact varies based on the type of XSS and the context of the vulnerable application.",
        "Confidentiality": "Attackers can steal sensitive user data, including login credentials, personal information, and session tokens.",
        "Integrity": "Malicious scripts can modify the content of the web page, potentially misleading users or damaging the site's reputation.",
        "Availability": "In some cases, XSS can be used to crash browsers or make parts of a website unusable, affecting the availability of the service.",
        "Sample": "An attacker could inject a script that steals user session cookies, allowing them to impersonate the user and access their account."
    },
    "Remediation": [
        "Implement proper input validation and output encoding for all user-supplied input.",
        "Use Content Security Policy (CSP) headers to restrict the sources of content that can be loaded on your web pages.",
        "Sanitize user input on both the client-side and server-side to prevent script injection.",
        "Use framework-specific XSS protection features when available.",
        "Regularly update and patch all components of your web application stack."
