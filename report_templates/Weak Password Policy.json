{
    "Test case title": "Weak Password Policy",
    "Background Information": "A weak password policy allows users to create and use passwords that are easily guessable or vulnerable to brute-force attacks. This can include short passwords, commonly used passwords, or passwords without sufficient complexity. Weak password policies significantly reduce the security of user accounts and, by extension, the entire application or system. They make it easier for attackers to gain unauthorized access through password guessing, dictionary attacks, or credential stuffing.",
    "Impact": {
        "Overall": "Weak passwords can lead to unauthorized access to user accounts, potentially resulting in data breaches, identity theft, or further system compromise.",
        "Confidentiality": "Easily guessed or cracked passwords can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive user data and functionality.",
        "Integrity": "Compromised accounts can be used to modify or delete data, potentially affecting the integrity of the entire system.",
        "Availability": "Large-scale account compromises due to weak passwords could lead to service disruptions or lockouts.",
        "Sample": "An attacker using a list of common passwords could gain access to multiple user accounts in a short time, potentially including administrative accounts."
    },
    "Remediation": [
        "Implement a strong password policy that requires:",
        "- Minimum password length (e.g., at least 12 characters)",
        "- Combination of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters",
        "- Prohibition of commonly used or easily guessable passwords",
        "- Regular password changes (though forced frequent changes are now discouraged)",
        "Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) to add an extra layer of security.",
        "Use password strength meters to encourage users to create strong passwords.",
        "Implement account lockout policies after a certain number of failed login attempts.",
        "Consider using password managers or single sign-on (SSO) solutions.",
        "Educate users about the importance of strong, unique passwords and good password hygiene."
