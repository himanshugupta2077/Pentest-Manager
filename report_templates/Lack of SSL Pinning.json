    "Test case title": "Lack of SSL Pinning",
    "Background Information": "SSL pinning is a technique used to prevent man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks by associating a host with its expected X509 certificate or public key. Without SSL pinning, an app might accept any valid certificate for a host, potentially allowing an attacker with a fraudulent certificate to intercept communications.",
    "Impact": {
        "Overall": "Lack of SSL pinning can expose the app to MITM attacks, potentially compromising all data transmitted between the app and server.",
        "Confidentiality": "Sensitive data could be intercepted and read by attackers.",
        "Integrity": "Intercepted data could be modified before reaching its destination.",
        "Availability": "While primarily a confidentiality and integrity issue, severe breaches could impact user trust and app usage.",
        "Sample": "An attacker could use a fraudulent certificate to intercept and decrypt all traffic between the app and server, including login credentials and sensitive user data."
    },
    "Remediation": [
        "We recommend implementing SSL pinning in the app, either by pinning the certificate or the public key. For certificate pinning, we suggest including the server's certificate in the app bundle and verifying it during the SSL handshake.",
        "We also recommend using a reputable library for implementing SSL pinning, such as TrustKit for iOS or Android Network Security Config for Android. Additionally, we suggest implementing a backup mechanism to update the pinned certificates in case of certificate expiration or compromise.",
        "Lastly, we recommend regularly reviewing and updating the SSL pinning implementation to ensure it remains effective against evolving threats. We also suggest implementing certificate transparency (CT) checking as an additional layer of security."
