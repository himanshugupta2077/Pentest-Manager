{
    "Test case title": "Weak Transport Layer Security (TLS) - Weak Cipher Suite Usage",
    "Background Information": "Weak Transport Layer Security refers to the use of outdated or insecure TLS protocols or cipher suites. This can include the use of older versions of SSL/TLS (e.g., SSL 3.0, TLS 1.0), weak encryption algorithms, or insecure cipher modes. Using weak TLS configurations can make encrypted communications vulnerable to various attacks, potentially allowing attackers to decrypt, modify, or intercept sensitive data in transit.",
    "Impact": {
        "Overall": "Weak TLS configurations can compromise the security of all data transmitted between the client and server, potentially leading to data breaches, session hijacking, and other security incidents.",
        "Confidentiality": "Weak encryption can allow attackers to decrypt and access sensitive data transmitted over the network.",
        "Integrity": "Some weak cipher suites are vulnerable to attacks that allow data modification in transit.",
        "Availability": "While primarily a confidentiality and integrity issue, certain attacks on weak TLS can lead to denial of service.",
        "Sample": "An attacker exploiting a weak cipher suite could potentially decrypt sensitive information like login credentials or personal data transmitted over HTTPS."
    },
    "Remediation": [
        "Disable support for outdated and insecure SSL/TLS versions (SSL 2.0, SSL 3.0, TLS 1.0, TLS 1.1).",
        "Use only strong, modern cipher suites that support perfect forward secrecy (PFS).",
        "Prioritize cipher suites to prefer stronger algorithms.",
        "Regularly update server software and libraries to support the latest secure TLS versions and cipher suites.",
        "Use tools like SSL Labs' SSL Server Test to assess your TLS configuration.",
        "Implement HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) to enforce HTTPS connections.",
        "Keep private keys secure and use strong key exchange methods.",
        "Regularly audit and update TLS configurations to align with current best practices."
