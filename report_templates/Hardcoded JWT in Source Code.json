{
    "Test case title": "Hardcoded JWT in Source Code",
    "Background Information": "JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) are often used for authentication and authorization in web applications. Hardcoding JWTs in the source code is a severe security risk as it can lead to unauthorized access and potential system compromise. This practice violates the principle of keeping secrets separate from code and can result in accidental exposure through version control systems or code sharing.",
    "Impact": {
        "Overall": "Hardcoded JWTs can lead to unauthorized access to protected resources and potential system compromise.",
        "Confidentiality": "Attackers with access to the source code can use the hardcoded JWT to impersonate legitimate users and access sensitive data.",
        "Integrity": "Unauthorized access via hardcoded JWTs may allow malicious actors to modify or delete data they shouldn't have access to.",
        "Availability": "While primarily a confidentiality and integrity issue, widespread unauthorized access could potentially impact system availability.",
        "Sample": "An attacker finding a hardcoded admin JWT in the frontend code could use it to gain administrative access to the system."
    },
    "Remediation": [
        "Remove all hardcoded JWTs from the source code.",
        "Implement proper authentication flows to generate and manage JWTs securely.",
        "Store sensitive information like JWT secrets in secure configuration management systems or environment variables.",
        "Implement short expiration times for JWTs and use refresh tokens where necessary.",
        "Regularly rotate JWT signing keys and secrets.",
        "Use code review processes and automated scanning tools to detect hardcoded secrets.",
        "Educate developers about the risks of hardcoding sensitive information."
