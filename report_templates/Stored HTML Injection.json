    "Test case title": "Stored HTML Injection",
    "Background Information": "Stored HTML Injection is a vulnerability where an attacker can insert malicious HTML code into a web application's storage (e.g., database), which is then served to other users. This is particularly dangerous as it can affect multiple users and persist across sessions.",
    "Impact": {
        "Overall": "Stored HTML Injection can lead to persistent cross-site scripting attacks, potentially affecting multiple users and leading to widespread data theft or account compromises.",
        "Confidentiality": "Injected scripts could steal sensitive user data from anyone who views the affected page.",
        "Integrity": "Malicious HTML could alter the appearance or behavior of the application for affected users.",
        "Availability": "In extreme cases, injected content could crash browsers or make parts of the application unusable.",
        "Sample": "An attacker could inject a script into a comment field that steals the session cookies of any user who views the comment."
    },
    "Remediation": [
        "We recommend implementing strict input validation and output encoding for all user-generated content that is stored and later displayed. Additionally, we suggest using a library like DOMPurify to sanitize HTML content before storing or displaying it.",
        "We also recommend implementing Content Security Policy (CSP) headers to restrict the types of content that can be loaded or executed on your pages. Furthermore, we suggest using HttpOnly flags on sensitive cookies to prevent them from being accessed by client-side scripts.",
        "Lastly, we recommend regularly scanning your application for stored XSS vulnerabilities, particularly in areas where user-generated content is displayed. We also suggest implementing a feature to allow administrators to easily remove or sanitize suspicious content."
