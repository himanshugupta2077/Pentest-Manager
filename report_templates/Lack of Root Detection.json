    "Test case title": "Lack of Root Detection",
    "Background Information": "Rooting is the process of allowing users of smartphones, tablets, and other devices running Android to attain privileged control (known as root access) over various Android subsystems. A rooted device can pose significant security risks as it allows users to bypass security controls and potentially compromise the device and any apps running on it.",
    "Impact": {
        "Overall": "Lack of root detection can expose the app to various security risks, including unauthorized access to app data, code injection, and runtime manipulation.",
        "Confidentiality": "Sensitive app data could be accessed by malicious software on a rooted device.",
        "Integrity": "The app's code and behavior could be modified on a rooted device.",
        "Availability": "Malicious software on a rooted device could interfere with the app's normal operation.",
        "Sample": "On a rooted device, a malicious app could use root privileges to access and modify your app's private data storage."
    },
    "Remediation": [
        "We recommend implementing root detection mechanisms in the app. This can include checking for the presence of su binaries, verifying the integrity of system partitions, and detecting common rooting tools and apps.",
        "We also suggest using multiple detection methods and obfuscating the detection code to make it harder for attackers to bypass. Additionally, we recommend implementing appropriate responses when root access is detected, such as limiting app functionality or securely wiping sensitive data.",
        "Lastly, we recommend regularly updating the root detection mechanisms to keep up with new rooting techniques. We also suggest educating users about the risks of using the app on a rooted device and encouraging them to maintain the security of their devices."
