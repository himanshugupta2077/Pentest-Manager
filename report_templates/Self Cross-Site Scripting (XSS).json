    "Test case title": "Self Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
    "Background Information": "Self XSS is a type of cross-site scripting vulnerability where the victim unknowingly executes malicious scripts on their own browser. Unlike traditional XSS, the attacker typically needs to convince the user to enter and execute the malicious code themselves, often through social engineering tactics.",
    "Impact": {
        "Overall": "While less severe than traditional XSS, Self XSS can still lead to unauthorized access to user data and potential account compromise.",
        "Confidentiality": "Sensitive user information could be stolen if the user is tricked into executing malicious scripts.",
        "Integrity": "Malicious scripts could modify the behavior of the application from the user's perspective.",
        "Availability": "Executed scripts could potentially crash the browser or disrupt the application's functionality.",
        "Sample": "A user could be tricked into pasting a malicious script into their browser's console, leading to the theft of their session cookie."
    },
    "Remediation": [
        "We recommend implementing strict input validation and output encoding for all user-generated content, even if it's only displayed to the user who entered it. Additionally, we suggest using Content Security Policy (CSP) headers to restrict the sources of content that can be loaded or executed by the browser.",
        "We also recommend educating users about the risks of copying and pasting unknown code into the browser console or other input fields. Furthermore, we suggest implementing warnings or restrictions on the use of potentially dangerous HTML tags or attributes in user inputs.",
        "Lastly, we recommend regularly reviewing and updating your XSS prevention mechanisms to ensure they remain effective against evolving threats. We also suggest considering the use of auto-escaping templates to automatically encode user-generated content in different contexts."
