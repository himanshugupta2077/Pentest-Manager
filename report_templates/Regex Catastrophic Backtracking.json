    "Test case title": "Regex Catastrophic Backtracking in Source Code",
    "Background Information": "Regex catastrophic backtracking is a situation where a regular expression pattern can cause exponential time complexity when processing certain input strings. This occurs when the regex engine needs to try many different ways to match a pattern, potentially leading to extremely long processing times or even application hangs. In the context of web applications, this can be exploited as a denial of service vector.",
    "Impact": {
        "Overall": "Regex catastrophic backtracking can lead to severe performance issues and potential denial of service.",
        "Confidentiality": "While primarily a performance issue, in some cases, it might cause the application to timeout and reveal system information in error messages.",
        "Integrity": "No direct impact on data integrity.",
        "Availability": "Can cause significant CPU consumption, leading to application unresponsiveness or crashes.",
        "Sample": "A malicious user could submit an input string designed to trigger catastrophic backtracking in a vulnerable regex, causing the server to hang or crash."
    },
    "Remediation": [
        "Review and optimize all regular expressions used in the application, especially those processing user input.",
        "Avoid using nested quantifiers in regular expressions (e.g., (a+)+) as they are often prone to catastrophic backtracking.",
        "Use atomic grouping or possessive quantifiers where appropriate to prevent unnecessary backtracking.",
        "Implement timeout mechanisms for regex operations to prevent indefinite processing.",
        "Consider using regex libraries that are designed to prevent catastrophic backtracking.",
        "Test regular expressions with various inputs, including edge cases and malicious patterns.",
        "Use tools like RegexBuddy or regex101.com to analyze and optimize regular expressions.",
        "Educate developers about regex best practices and potential pitfalls."
