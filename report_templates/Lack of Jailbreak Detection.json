    "Test case title": "Lack of Jailbreak Detection",
    "Background Information": "Jailbreaking is the process of removing software restrictions imposed by iOS, Apple's operating system. A jailbroken device can pose significant security risks as it allows users to install unauthorized software that could compromise the device and any apps running on it.",
    "Impact": {
        "Overall": "Lack of jailbreak detection can expose the app to various security risks, including unauthorized access to app data, code injection, and runtime manipulation.",
        "Confidentiality": "Sensitive app data could be accessed by malicious software on a jailbroken device.",
        "Integrity": "The app's code and behavior could be modified on a jailbroken device.",
        "Availability": "Malicious software on a jailbroken device could interfere with the app's normal operation.",
        "Sample": "On a jailbroken device, a malicious app could access the keychain and steal sensitive data stored by your app."
    },
    "Remediation": [
        "We recommend implementing jailbreak detection mechanisms in the app. This can include checking for the presence of common jailbreak files or directories, attempting to write to protected areas of the filesystem, and checking for the ability to fork processes.",
        "We also suggest implementing multiple detection methods and obfuscating the detection code to make it harder for attackers to bypass. Additionally, we recommend implementing appropriate responses when a jailbreak is detected, such as limiting app functionality or securely wiping sensitive data.",
        "Lastly, we recommend regularly updating the jailbreak detection mechanisms to keep up with new jailbreaking techniques. We also suggest educating users about the risks of using the app on a jailbroken device and encouraging them to maintain the security of their devices."
