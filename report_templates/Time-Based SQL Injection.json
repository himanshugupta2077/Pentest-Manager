    "Test case title": "Time-Based SQL Injection",
    "Background Information": "Time-based SQL injection is a technique used to exploit SQL injection vulnerabilities when there is no visible output from the application. The attacker infers the result of their injection by observing the time the server takes to respond to queries.",
    "Impact": {
        "Overall": "Time-based SQL injection can lead to unauthorized access to the database, potentially exposing sensitive data or allowing data manipulation.",
        "Confidentiality": "Attackers could extract sensitive information from the database, even if it's not directly displayed by the application.",
        "Integrity": "With successful exploitation, an attacker could potentially modify or delete database contents.",
        "Availability": "Crafted time-based queries could significantly slow down the database, affecting application performance.",
        "Sample": "An attacker could use time-based techniques to slowly extract the contents of a password table, even if the application doesn't display database errors."
    },
    "Remediation": [
        "We recommend using parameterized queries or prepared statements for all database operations to prevent SQL injection. Additionally, we suggest implementing an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library, which can provide an additional layer of protection against SQL injection.",
        "We also recommend implementing strict input validation and sanitization for all user-supplied data used in database queries. Furthermore, we suggest applying the principle of least privilege to database accounts used by the application, limiting the potential impact of a successful injection.",
        "Lastly, we recommend regularly auditing your codebase for potential SQL injection vulnerabilities, particularly in legacy code or third-party components. We also suggest implementing Web Application Firewalls (WAF) and intrusion detection systems as additional layers of defense against SQL injection attempts."
